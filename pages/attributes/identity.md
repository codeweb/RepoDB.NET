# Identity

---

This is an attribute that is being used to mark the property of the class as an identity property.

> It is very important to take note that the library knows your schema, and with that, you do not need to decorate your class with this attribute as it is automatically been identified internally.

### How to implement?

Let us say you have a the table named `[dbo].[Person]` where the field `Id` is an identity.

```csharp
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Person]
(
    [Id] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [Name] [nvarchar](128) NOT NULL,
    [Age] [int] NOT NULL,
    [CreatedDateUtc] [datetime2](5) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [CRIX_Person_Id] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([Id] ASC) ON [PRIMARY]
)
ON [PRIMARY];
GO
```

And a model class named `Person` like below.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    [Identity] // Identity decoration
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedDateUtc { get; set; }
}
```

> By setting this attribute to any class property, you had overriden the auto-identification logic of the library. If you place this attribute in a property that is not really an identity from the database, then the library will use that property instead. By doing so, it may fail some of the operations.

### How to Retrieve?

To retrieve the identity property, you can use the [IdentityCache](/cacher/identitycache) object.

```csharp
var identity = IdentityCache.Get<Person>();
```

Or via .NET CLR type.

```csharp
var identity = IdentityCache.Get(typeof(Person));
```
